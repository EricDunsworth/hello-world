## Welcome to my GitHub first steps 

Here is one of my favourite quotes: 

> Do or do not, there is no try

This is my first attempt at GitHub. This is my first commit of many. Here's hoping the fun never stops. 

## A Bit About Me

Hi Everyone! This is very exciting. My Background is in Computer Science. My day job is in Web Development. However, after hours is where my fascination for coding begins. I also love chicken wings. 


## What is to become of the Hello-world Repo

Sadly, not much will happen in this hello-world repo. I'm following along in the tutorial, and will complete the activities defined. However beyond that this repo may just die. Once I'm more familiar with this world of GitHub I might just blow away the repo. 


## Merging pull requests rocks!

Yeah!
